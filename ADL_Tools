Overview Cited An Architecture Description Language for Massively Parallel Processor Architectures


Many architecture description languages have been developed in the field of retargetable compilation. In the following, we list only some of the most significant ADLs. For instance, the hardware description language nML [3] permits concise, hierarchical processor descriptions in a behavioral style. nML is used in the CBC/SIGH/SIM framework [2] and the CHESS system [6]. The machine description language LISA [15] is the basis for a retargetable compiled simulator approach developed at RWTH Aachen, Germany. The project focuses on fast simulator generation for already existing architectures to be modeled in LISA. At the ACES laboratory of the University of California, Irvine, the architecture description language EXPRESSION [8] has been developed. From an EXPRESSION description of an architecture, the retargetable compiler Express and a cycle-accurate simulator can be automatically generated. The Trimaran system [19] has been designed to generate efficient VLIW code. It is based on a fixed basic architecture (HPL-PD) being parameterizable in the number of registers, the number of functional units, and operation latencies. Parameters of the machine are specified in the description language HMDES. MIMOLA [13] is one of RT-level ADLs. It was developed at the University of Kiel, Germany. Originally, it targeted at micro-architecture modeling and design. ISDL is one of Instruction Set Description Languages. It was developed at MIT and is used by the Aviv compiler [10] and the associated assembler. It was also used by the simulator generation system GENSIM [7]. The target architectures for ISDL are VLIW ASIPs. Maril is an ADL used by the retargetable compiler Marion [1]. It contains both instruction set information as well as coarse-grained structural information. The target architectures for Maril are RISC style processors only. There is no distinction between instruction and operation in Maril. TDL stands for target description language. It has been developed at Saarland University in Germany. The language is used in a retargetable post-pass assembly-based code optimization system called PROPAN [11]. Another architecture description language is PRMDL [17]. PRMDL stands for Philips Research Machine Description Language. The target architectures for PRMDL are clustered VLIW architectures. Finally, we refer to the Machine Markup Language (MAML) which has been developed in the BUILDABONG project [4]. MAML is used for the efficient architecture/compiler co-generation of ASIPs and VLIW processor architectures. For a more complete ADLâ€™s summary we point out to the surveys in [16], [18], and [14]. All these ADLs have in common that they have been developed for the design of single processor architectures such as ASIPs which might contain VLIW execution. But, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no ADL which covers the architectural aspects of massively parallel processor arrays. Of course, one could use hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL but these languages are too low level and offer only insufficient possibilities to describe behavioral aspects.

# Wikis about ADLs

Architecture description languages (ADLs) are used in several disciplines: system engineering, software engineering, and enterprise modelling and engineering. The system engineering community uses an architecture description language as a language and/or a conceptual model to describe and represent system architectures. 
The software engineering community uses an architecture description language as a computer language to create a description of a software architecture. In the case of a so-called technical architecture, the architecture must be communicated to software developers; a functional architecture is communicated to various stakeholders and users. Some ADLs that have been developed are: Acme (developed by CMU), AADL (standardized by the SAE), C2 (developed by UCI), SBC-ADL (developed by National Sun Yat-Sen University), Darwin (developed by Imperial College London), and Wright (developed by CMU).
