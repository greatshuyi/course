Fast and Small Short Vector SIMD Matrix Multiplication Kernels for the Synergistic Processing Element of the CELL Processor

SPU & SPE单元特点：

The core of the SPE is the Synergistic Processing Unit (SPU). 
The SPU [39–41] is a RISC-style SIMD processor feturing 128 general purpose registers and 32-bit fixed length instruction encoding.
SPU includes instructions that perform single precision floating point, integer arithmetic, logicals, loads, stores, compares and branches. 
SPU includes nine execution units organized into two pipelines, referred to as the odd and even pipeline.
Instructions are issued in-order and two independent instructions can be issued simultaneously if they belong to different pipelines.
SPU executes code form the Local Store and operates on data residing in the Local Store, which is a fully pipelined, single-ported, 256 KB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). 
Load and store instructions are performed within local address space, which is untranslated, unguarded and noncoherent with respect to the system address space. 
Loads and stores transfer 16 bytes of data between the register file and the Local Store, and complete with fixed six-cycle delay and without exception.
SPU does not perform hardware branch prediction and omits branch history tables. Instead, the SPU includes a Software Managed Branch Target
Buffer (SMBTB), which holds a single branch target and is loaded by software. A mispredicted branch flushes the pipelines and costs 18 cycles. A correctly
hinted branch can execute in one cycle. Since both branch hint and branch instructions belong to the odd pipeline, proper use of SMBTB can result in zero
overhead from branching for a compute-intensive loop dominated by even pipeline instructions
